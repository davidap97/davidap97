Hi, Iâ€™m @davidap97,

My research interests during my Bachelor's and Master's degrees were primarily focused on the field of universal quantum computing. The necessity for operator controllability of the qubit array in universal quantum computing is typically fulfilled through the utilization of qubit-qubit couplings and local external controls on each qubit. However, this approach becomes challenging when scaling to large numbers of qubits. In light of these considerations, I sought to determine whether it was possible to reduce the number of local controls while still maintaining the ability to perform universal quantum computing. I have demonstrated that a single external control is sufficient for operator controllability of three qubits. However, this comes at the expense of longer gate durations. Consequently, an investigation was conducted into the relationship between gate duration and the number of local controls. It was demonstrated that reducing the number of controls increases the quantum speed limit, defined as the shortest time to generate a quantum gate. This limit was determined for a universal set of gates for different 3-qubit systems using quantum optimal control.

The notebooks provided here reflect my research interests. For example, the notebooks include operator controllability tests and OCT methods for a quantum speed limit search. At this time, I am particularly interested in further developing my programming abilities. It is for this reason that I am interested in learning Julia and Fortran.
