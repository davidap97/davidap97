Hi, Iâ€™m @davidap97,

I am a theoretical quantum physicist with a particular interest in data analytics and its many applications. For example, I like to investigate how data analysis for process optimisation can be useful for businesses.

I utilise Python for my personal interests, particularly for data analysis. It allows me to apply similar methods to evaluate data sets in a wide range of problem areas.
By employing statistical tools, it is possible to identify trends and regularities in the evaluation of a physical experiment, a series of numerical simulations, or an order process optimisation for e-commerce businesses. The broad application of these methods is particularly fascinating.

My research interests during my Bachelor's and Master's degrees were primarily focused on the field of universal quantum computing. For example, the notebooks include operator controllability tests and OCT methods for a quantum speed limit search. The necessity for operator controllability of the qubit array in universal quantum computing is typically fulfilled through the utilization of qubit-qubit couplings and local external controls on each qubit. However, this approach becomes challenging when scaling to large numbers of qubits. In light of these considerations, I sought to determine whether it was possible to reduce the number of local controls while still maintaining the ability to perform universal quantum computing. I have demonstrated that a single external control is sufficient for operator controllability of three qubits. However, this comes at the expense of longer gate durations. Consequently, an investigation was conducted into the relationship between gate duration and the number of local controls. It was demonstrated that reducing the number of controls increases the quantum speed limit, defined as the shortest time to generate a quantum gate. This limit was determined for a universal set of gates for different 3-qubit systems using quantum optimal control.
